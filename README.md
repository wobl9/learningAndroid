# learningAndroid

This is sample app for learning android.

Required features that should be implemented:
1) List of films in FilmsFragment. Design doesn't matter.
2) Screen with detailed film info. We should navigate to it from list in first feature.
3) Implement simple authorization based on saved in preferences values
4) Implement search options. Availability to get popular/upcoming/top rated films and change language. https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details

Advanced:
1) Implement cache. Update films if last update was more than 10 mins.
2) Implement pagination.
3) Implement real auth with headers. https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/how-do-i-generate-a-session-id
